2. Vulnerabilities: Identifying weaknesses or vulnerabilities in IT systems, data, and processes that could be exploited by threats.
3. Risk Events: Identifying potential risk events, such as data breaches, system downtime, or compliance failures, that could occur as a result of threats and vulnerabilities.
4. Risk Factors: Identifying risk factors, such as regulatory requirements, industry trends, or geopolitical events, that could impact IT risk.controls
